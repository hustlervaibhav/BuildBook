# BuildBook
A stunning Netflix-inspired portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills. Built with Flutter Web using MVVM architecture, featuring smooth animations, responsive design, and interactive project cards. Perfect blend of modern UI/UX and clean code architecture.
My Netflix-Inspired Portfolio Website: A Showcase of My Projects and Skills
This isn't just a portfolio; it's a little corner of the internet I built to show off what I can do, all wrapped up in a design that'll feel super familiar if you've ever spent an entire weekend binging a show. 

Why Netflix?
I've always loved the clean, intuitive design of Netflix, so I thought, "Why not build my portfolio around that?" This project was a blast to create and helped me focus on some key areas:

A killer UI/UX: The whole thing uses a dark theme with those iconic red accents. I put a lot of work into the details, from the smooth entrance animations on the hero section to the hover effects on the project cards.

Built for everyone: It's totally responsive. Whether you're on a phone, a tablet, or a big ol' desktop monitor, the site looks and works great. I tested it on all the major browsers, too!

Under the hood: I built this using the MVVM architecture for a really clean separation of concerns. I also relied on the Provider pattern for state management, which kept things organized and efficient. It's also lazy-loaded and optimized for a silky-smooth 60fps experience.

Interactive Goodness
This portfolio isn't just a static page; it‚Äôs meant to be a fun, interactive experience.

Filter away! You can easily filter projects by technology‚Äîwant to see only my Flutter projects? Easy.

Project Layout
I designed this to be clean and easy to navigate. Everything's housed in a multiple divided and structured folders, but don't let that fool you‚Äîit still follows a solid, clean architecture. It's a great example of how to keep a project tidy even when it's all in one place.

lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart # Everything is here, beautifully organized
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models # Your data structures live here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services # The logic for fetching data

What's in there?
The Hero Section: Your first impression! It's an animated intro with my name, title, and little skill badges. Plus, some buttons that smoothly scroll you down the page.

Skills Navigation: This is where you can filter projects by category like "Flutter," "React," and more. The animated indicators make it easy to see what you've selected.

Project Showcase: A neat grid layout with all my projects, complete with hover effects, tech badges, and links to GitHub and live demos.

Contact Section: All my contact info is right here, ready for you to reach out.

Customize it for yourself!
This project is open-source and meant to be a template for your own portfolio. It's super easy to make it your own.

Adding your projects:

Just pop your project details into the PortfolioService.fetchSkillCategories() method. Replace my images and links with yours. It's just a simple list of objects, like this:

Dart

Project(
  id: 'your_project_id',
  title: 'Your Awesome Project!',
  description: 'A little description of the cool stuff you built.',
  imageUrl: 'https://your-screenshot-url.com/image.png',
  technologies: ['Flutter', 'Firebase'],
  githubUrl: 'https://github.com/your-username/project',
  liveUrl: 'https://your-live-demo.com',
  duration: '3 months',
  category: 'Mobile App',
),
Personalizing the text:

Just search for "Vaibhav Shukla" and replace it with your name. Do the same for your title, contact info, and skills.

Theming:

I used Colors.red to match the Netflix vibe, but you can change that main color and the accent colors to whatever you want.

The files will be in the build/web/ folder. Just upload those to your gh-pages branch.
